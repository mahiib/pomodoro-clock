# This is a pomodoro clock (timer), it is built using React JS.

# The pomodoro clock works on these six steps:

1.Decide on the task to be done.
2.Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).[1]
3.Work on the task.
4.End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).[5]
5.If you have fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.
After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (traditionally 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
